# CS_Closest_Point_By_DaQ
 Get the two closest points through divide and conquer algorithm.

 Coordinates are first sorted by increasing x-coordinate value.
 Coordinates are then divided into left and right regions recursively. Smallest region defined less than 4 points.
 Brute force comparison method applied.
 Distance between points of left and right region are also considered.
